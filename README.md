# Competitive Programming

This repo contains the code Team Rachel wrote for the 2 competitive programming contests.

The team includes [Nitay Reiter](https://github.com/NitayRe), [Jonathan Langer](https://github.com/Jonathan-Langer) and [Ori Dabush](https://github.com/dabushori).

There were two contests:

The first contest contained 7 problems, and we managed to solve 3 of them and finish in the 2nd place. A partial solution for another problem (problem D) is supplied (the solution doesn't work but it is the correct idea). [This](https://vjudge.net/contest/535909#rank) is the contest's result page.

The second contest contained 9 problems, and we managed to solve 8 of them and finish in the 1st place. A solution to another problem that we thought of but didn't have time to program is now programmed (problem D). [This](https://vjudge.net/contest/535968#rank) is the contest's result page.

The solutions for the first contest can be found in `comp1`, and the solutions for the second contest can be found in `comp2`.

You can also run some tests using the [CPH vs-code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) (you'll need to open the `comp1` or `comp2` directories with vs-code, change the paths to the source files in the config files in the .cph directories and then open a cpp file to view the tests).

To view the problems you can open the contests' links above.
