# Competitive Programming

This repo is the code Team Rachel wrote for the 2 programming contests we had.

The team includes [Nitay Reiter](https://github.com/NitayRe), [Jonathan Langer](https://github.com/Jonathan-Langer) and me.

We had two contests:

The first contest contained 7 problems, and we managed to solve 3 of them and finish in the 2nd place. [This](https://vjudge.net/contest/535909#rank) is the contest's result page.

The first contest contained 9 problems, and we managed to solve 8 of them and finish in the 1st place. [This](https://vjudge.net/contest/535968#rank) is the contest's result page.

In this repo our solutions to the problems we solved can be found. There are also some solution to questions that we had the solution in our mind and didn't manage to program it in time.

The solutions for the first contest can be found in `comp1`, and the solutions for the second contest can be found in `comp2`.

You can also run some tests using the [CPH vs-code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) (you'll need to open the `comp1` or `comp2` directories with vs-code and then open a cpp file to view the tests, and maybe play a little bit with the config files).

To view the problems you can open the contests' links above.
